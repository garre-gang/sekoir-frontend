The hooks folder contains custom React hooks that enable the reusability of logic across different components in the application. Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React to manage stateful logic and side effects in functional components.

In this folder, you can find hooks such as useFetch, useLocalStorage, useAuth, useTheme, etc. These hooks encapsulate common patterns and behaviors, allowing developers to easily access and reuse complex logic without duplicating code.
