This folder contains reusable utility functions and classes that can be used throughout the application. It provides a centralized location for common code that can be shared across different components and modules.

The lib folder typically includes helper functions, API wrappers, data manipulation utilities, and any other code that doesn't fit into a specific module or component but is essential for the application's functionality.
